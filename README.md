p44maintd
=========

p44maintd is a utility used for configuration and maintainance of p44 devices
built based on OpenWrt, abstracting a few things like hardware and product
configuration, network setup etc.

The only use for it is in complete OpenWrt based device builds. These consist
of an umbrella package having a dependency on p44maintd and the other components
required for a working setup. See those umbrella packages (named xxx-config)
for more information.
